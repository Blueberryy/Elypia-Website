          Commandler is a genertic command handling framework for Java that
          allows you to write your code once and integrate it anywhere
          or multiple places in a single application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commandler will handle all the work so it keeps implementing

        <p>
          Elypiai is a small but useful library that provides wraps for
          many APIs available online that don't already have official implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          All wraps have been abstracted as to make it more consistent between
          web services you're implementing and maximise pooling resources.
